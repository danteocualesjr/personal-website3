# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications with ease. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of Next.js and how to get started with your first project.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React applications:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial load performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build backend functionality alongside your frontend
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing system
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, code splitting, and more

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration files.

## Key Concepts

### Pages and Routing

In Next.js, the file structure determines your routes. Files in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory in Next.js 13+) automatically become routes.

### Server Components

Next.js 13+ introduces React Server Components, which allow you to fetch data directly in your components without client-side JavaScript.

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its combination of performance optimizations, developer experience, and flexibility makes it a top choice for many developers.
