# The Last Message

The notification appeared at 3:47 AM, glowing softly in the darkness of her bedroom. Sarah reached for her phone, expecting spam or a misdialed call. Instead, she saw a message from her father.

*"I love you. Always remember that."*

Her father had died six months ago.

## The First Message

Sarah sat up, her heart racing. The message was dated today—February 15th, 2024. But that was impossible. She scrolled through their conversation history. The last message from him was dated August 10th, 2023, the day before his accident.

*"See you for dinner tomorrow?"*

She had never replied.

## The Algorithm

Sarah called the phone company, then the messaging service. Both confirmed what she already knew: the message couldn't have been sent. His account had been closed. His phone was destroyed in the accident.

Yet there it was, sitting in her inbox like a ghost.

She spent the next week investigating, talking to engineers and data scientists. One explained it to her: her father had set up a series of scheduled messages before he died. Messages for birthdays, holidays, moments when he thought she might need to hear from him.

"But this one wasn't scheduled," Sarah insisted. "It's not a holiday. It's not my birthday."

The engineer looked at her with something like pity. "Sometimes," he said, "the system learns. It learns patterns, emotions, timing. It might have sent this because it detected something—a pattern in your behavior, perhaps. Or maybe it just knew you needed to hear from him."

## The Understanding

Sarah went back to their last conversation. She read through years of messages—quick check-ins, inside jokes, the mundane details of daily life. She realized how much she had taken for granted. How many times she had been too busy to reply. How many conversations had been left unfinished.

The message at 3:47 AM had arrived during one of those nights when she couldn't sleep, when grief felt like a physical weight on her chest. When she needed to hear from him most.

## The Reply

Sarah typed a response, knowing it would never be delivered. Knowing it would go nowhere, into the void of a closed account.

*"I love you too, Dad. I'm sorry I never replied. I'm sorry I was always too busy. I miss you every day."*

She sent it anyway.

And in that moment, she understood. The message wasn't about technology or algorithms or scheduled deliveries. It was about the words that needed to be said, the conversations that needed to happen, even if one person was no longer there to have them.

Some messages, she realized, aren't meant to be received. They're meant to be sent.

*The end.*
